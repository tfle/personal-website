# Welcome to my humble abode

I am a Master of IT student at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au). You may also know me from [USYD](https://www.sydney.edu.au), where I dabbled in Medical Physics, or [ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au), where I majored in Astronomy and Astrophysics.

I’ve been interested in science and technology for as long as I can remember, and I’m passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge with others. It's at the heart of many of my [personal projects](/projects).

Based in Sydney, I run [coding and robotics classes](/classes) where I help primary and secondary school students develop their problem-solving capability, communication skills and programming ability.

When I'm not collecting degrees, or teaching in the classroom, I like to keep busy maintaining [my digital garden](/wiki).
