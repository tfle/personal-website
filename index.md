# Welcome to my humble abode
{: .fs-9 }

I am a Master of IT student at **UNSW**. You may also know me from **USYD**, where I dabbled in Medical Physics, or **ANU**, where I majored in Astronomy and Astrophysics.

## About Me 🧑🏻‍💻

I’ve been interested in science and technology for as long as I can remember, and I’m passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge with others.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

I run coding and robotics classes in Sydney where I help primary and secondary school students develop their problem-solving capability, communication skills and programming ability.

When I'm not collecting degrees, or teaching in the classroom, I like to keep myself busy with unimportant nonsense like maintaining this website. 🌱
